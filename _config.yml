          ##### **Problem Statement**
          This project implements a real-time data pipeline that ingests stock market data, processes it, and provides actionable insights through an interactive dashboard. Using Apache Kafka for data streaming, Apache Spark for processing, and Tableau for visualization, the system handles high-volume financial data with low latency, enabling traders to make informed decisions quickly.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
